This document is a summary of what you need to know to work with me.

The most recent evaluation and update of these courses and modules was in early 2022.</p> <p>As platforms for teaching, we will focus on</p> <ul> <li>VMWare (Workstation, ESXi)</li> <li>Microsoft (Hyper-V)</li> <li>Proxmox</li> <li>Azure</li> <li>AWS</li> <li>Docker</li> </ul> <p>These modules assume no previous experience and are intended for delivery on L9 programs. However, you should have a relevant under-graduate degree before commencing.</p> <p>You are expected to achieve mastery over the duration of the module, do not underestimate the effort required.</p> <p>We deliver material via a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), currently Blackboard.</p> <p>Where teaching resources are provided, they will be deleted or removed in August each year. If you need access to images or environments after 15th August, you need to discuss with your lecturer directly.</p>"},{"location":"b/","title":"Grading","text":"<p>These modules are graded as 100% continuous assessment (CA), there are no terminal exams.</p> <p>As you submit CA, I grade it after the closing date. To enable you to be treated in a fair and balanced manner, I use a marking rubric. The idea is that whoever assesses your work will use the same rubric and will grade in a very similar manner. If you find the part of your submission has not been graded, and has no comments against it, bring it to my attention immediately. If you believe I have incorrectly graded your work, discuss with me immediately.</p> <p>The mark I show in the VLE is your provisional grade, it is how I think your work should be graded. Your provisional grades go to an external examiner and to an exam board word before they become your final grades. However, I don't think there's ever been a case where my provisional grade has not been accepted.</p> <p>If you have issues with the grade, you need to discuss those issues as soon as I put your provisional grade up in blackboard. Once your final grade is released, that is formal.</p> <p>For students who do written exams, we have a consultation day. As you have already had the opportunity to see my grading and discuss it, I normally don't see students on consultation day. However, if you do need to see me, make an appointment the week before.</p>"},{"location":"c/","title":"Software","text":"<p>You are entitled to a range of software as part of your registration. You should not need to separately purchase any software.</p> <p>Go to the Student Software page on the main web site and register for Microsoft Azure, Office etc. You should not need to separately buy any software for this module.</p> <p>As part of your Microsoft Office 365 entitlement, you have a cloud store. Make sure you can login to that now and take the time to understand how best to use it. As a computer student, you cannot lose documents or data and losing your work is not considered a valid reason for late or missing assessment submissions.</p> <p>Spend a few minutes figuring out how to recover documents which have been deleted or destroyed on OneDrive.</p> <p>Most students have their own computer, but there are particular requirements for this course as we will use virtualization. Read the section Computer Advice to understand our current recommendations.</p>"},{"location":"d/","title":"Professional conduct and netiquette","text":"<p>My guidelines are informal and unofficial, check the University's formal guidelines.</p> <p>Knowing how to behave professionally can be a challenge and varies in time and location; normal behavior in one time or place is unacceptable in another. This document aims to give you some simple guidelines as to how to behave in your interactions with lecturers, students and employers, both in person and on-line.</p> <p>In all my modules, I identify an online forum where module discussions should take place. If you ask questions here, other students should answer. If there is no good answer within a few days, I will answer.</p> <p>On most academic programs, students will also setup their own independent chat on social media. Occasionally, these forums may go bad, with toxic behavior. If this occurs, leave the forum and if there are serious issues, notify your lecturer.</p> <p>In recent years trends have emerged to describe the ever-changing view of what is acceptable and appropriate; it\u2019s a moving target which can be excessively applied. In this document, we are going to give some very simple guidelines.</p> <p>Firstly, the law is paramount; you need to adhere to the law in Ireland AND in the jurisdiction in which you are based. This document does NOT constitute legal advice!</p> <p>The only thing your lecturer is intolerant of is intolerance. You can expect us to treat you professionally, fairly and equally and respect your culture and background, we expect you to reciprocate with staff and other students. Most institutions refer to Virginia Shea\u2019s book \"Netiquette\", where she defines ten rules for network etiquette. Do some reading on-line and get a feeling for what the term means.</p> <p>In our course, the following rules apply.</p> <ol> <li>Make every effort not to cause offense to others.</li> <li>As everyone will be adhering to rule 1 (!) if anyone causes you offense, it is probably inadvertent. Do not over react, a professional must find common ground and resolve interpersonal problems. Resolve the issue in the most reasonable manner you can and involve the lecturer if you think it\u2019s necessary.</li> <li>A \u201cflame war\u201d is where two or more people have a public shouting match on line. This will result in all parties to the flame war having their discussion board access rights restricted in the interest of the other students.</li> </ol> <p>In our modules and courses, we expect professional conduct to include; - Tolerance! - Respect for the diversity of others - An ethic of consistent hard work and honesty - Punctuality - Integrity - Adherence to dress and behavior codes which are appropriate to the environment you are in</p> <p>A last word; you have strong technical skills and you know how to do a wide range of things. As the super-hero movies say, with great power comes great responsibility. In Ireland, we have some of the strictest laws on hacking in existence. You may not access or scan any user\u2019s computer system without written permission, even if you are doing so for ethical reasons. In Ireland, such activity carries a custodial sentence of up to ten years.</p>"},{"location":"e/","title":"Minding your data","text":"<p>There is a famous joke in Ireland. Whenever a child does not have their homework done, they claim that \u201cthe dog ate it\u201d. This is universally considered to be an invalid excuse!</p> <p>For a computer student to say their hard disk crashed and that they lost their work, is even worse. Hard disk failure is inevitable, given your specialty, you are supposed to know how to handle data and ensure that a predictable event does not result in data loss.</p> <p>The Institute provides access to One Drive. Before you begin to do any course work, read the guidance from Computer Services on how to use this. Then read Microsoft\u2019s own guidelines, so you know how to recover accidentally deleted files, etc.</p> <p>Save all course work to this drive, you can also keep ISO files, manuals etc. here. You can also access this information over the Internet and from home. Do NOT save VMs to your OneDrive. As a computer student, you should know how to recreate any VM which fails, reasonably quickly. Do not save work to a laboratory computer, they will be periodically wiped.</p> <p>A last word: we have verified with several veterinary surgeons, dogs do not generally eat USB drives or external SSDs, don't even think about using that excuse!</p>"},{"location":"f/","title":"Group Work","text":"<p>Many assignments on this program require group work. It is essential that you learn how to work effectively with others, in a co-operative and beneficial manner. When an orchestra plays together, it has a sound that instruments could not recreate if played individually. We call this benefit of a complex system an emergent property; that is what we are trying to achieve.</p> <p>As you are aware, every time you submit work, you use a cover sheet which declares this work to be your own. We need to clearly understand the parameters which allow us to work together, but to submit separate work. All work you submit must be your own and it must represent work that you yourself have done.</p> <p>You may not share your work with anyone else. If you pass your work to another student and they copy it, neither of you will be marked. You should not use another student\u2019s work, if you do, neither of you will be marked.</p> <p>If you are working with another student on the same equipment, you may have identical configuration files. You are only entitled to use configuration files which you have contributed to.</p> <p>Acknowledge in your documentation anyone who has contributed to your work or whom you have collaborated with.</p> <p>Note: under present Institute rules and guidelines, any student suspected of plagiarism will be processed through a formal disciplinary procedure. The lecturer does not have discretion.</p>"},{"location":"g/","title":"Using the Internet and AI","text":"<p>Over the years, we have all grown to use internet searches for non-authoritative answers. With many things in technology, there are no authoritative answers, just many hours of trying all the ways that do not work before finding the one that does. Is this desirable or acceptable; no. Is it normal, sadly yes.</p> <p>Part of being a scientist or engineer is learning how to discern the \"truth\", whatever that means!</p> <p>Just about every professional I know will do an internet search when they are trying to figure out how to write an algorithm or configure a system. A good professional will look at the suggested answers for new ideas, etc. but will not believe the results. They certainly will not cut-and-paste the answers. But do we use the tools? </p> <p>Absolutely!</p> <p>You are never to cut and paste from an Internet source or an AI application. Use them for ideas only.</p> <p>At the end of some modules, I will demonstrate how to do this in a way that should be acceptable. Until I have demonstrated how to do so, DO NOT USE THESE TOOLS!!</p> <p>In early 2025, one of my research collaborators asked me to write a parser for a domain specific language (DSL). To get an alpha version of code running took me a half day. He got an alpha version in 10 minutes using ChatGPT4. We tested them.</p> <p>My version worked! </p> <p>Note that if you use an answer from an AI tool and another user uses the same tool, your answers will be indistinguishable and treated as probable plagiarism.</p>"},{"location":"h/","title":"Connecting to the internet","text":""},{"location":"h/#eduroam","title":"Eduroam","text":"<p>Eduroam is an international federation which allows students, researchers and educators to access Wi-Fi, using their home institution credentials, on most university campuses, in most of the world.

I live on a hill in one of the most rural, boggy places in the country. My backup link currently gives me very good 5G coverage and many separate providers. I use a high-gain mobile antenna to improve on that. This currently costs me &lt;\u20ac15/month.</p>"},{"location":"i/","title":"Computer Requirements","text":"<p>You need to decide which type of device is most suitable for you. </p> <p>For distance education students who cannot access the campus, we are now recommending a desktop, not a laptop computer. This may also be the best solution for students who are doing modules in networking and virtualization and who need more memory than a laptop can cheaply provide. My practical exercises have been tested at a point in time and using conventional PC hardware. If you want to use any other desktop platform (Apple, Chrome Book, Linux), I cannot support it nor confirm that it will work. I have carried out all the practical exercises on a Dell Latitude 5580 from 2017 running Windows 10, with an i5 processor and 32 GB of DRAM. As I revalidate exercises, it is on a Dell 5520 from 2021 with Windows 11 and 32 GB of DRAM. </p> <p>In 2024 we discovered that older laptops may not run some virtualization software. If your laptop is &gt;3 years old, you may experience some issues, these are not insurmountable.</p> <p>You may already have a home computer or laptop; it may not be suitable for this module. Check first to see if it meets the specifications discussed above. If you are using an existing home computer or laptop you need to make sure it is performing well, clean, fully patched and has anti-virus. If your computer is old or slow, full of games (!) or is used by other members of your family, it is NOT suitable for you to use for home study.</p> <p>If you have a laptop from your employer, it will not be suitable for this course. Most companies will lock down their operating systems with Group Policies. These prevent you from installing any software or having administrative privileges. My University laptop has security policies imposed that downgrade it to the functionality of a paperweight!  Even Hyper-V or VMWare Workstation do not work correctly.</p> <p>Although in the past, some people did manage to get through this programme of study using Apple hardware, with the move to the new processors (M1, M2, etc) in 2020, Apple hardware is not compatible with the requirements for practical exercises.</p>"},{"location":"i/#laptop","title":"Laptop","text":"<p>A laptop is disposable, buy cheaply and expect to get three years out of it, maximum, if you are lugging it around every day. Treating laptops kindly, they may however last for years (I do have a perfectly working Dell laptop from 2008!).</p> <p>Pick a processor which supports virtualization. Most modern processors do but check before purchase. Typically, students buy an i3 or i5 processor or the AMD equivalent.</p> <p>I am now recommending 32GB of main memory for all students.</p> <p>Every laptop has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth but check to be sure.</p> <p>For performance, buy a laptop with an SSD (1TB) and learn how to use the cloud to store your data. This is the preferred option as otherwise when your hard drive breaks (it will!) you will lose important work. Newer laptops may have two slots for NVMe SSDs. On my main laptop, my OS is on the original 500GB SSD and I added a 2TB SSD for Virtual Machines.</p> <p>Without that, you will need an external USB3 SSD drive for VMs and ISOs.  Think of comfort! You should get a large monitor, keyboard, and mouse for working from home. Laptop ergonomics do not suit working for long periods of time. My laptop connects to external screens via a USB 3 docking station.</p> <p>Your laptop will come with Windows 11; that will be fine. You should not purchase additional software, as a registered student, you are entitled to MS Office and other software for free. We do NOT recommend buying commercial anti-virus software. Use the free version which comes with Windows 11. Make sure your computer is configured to download and install updates automatically. You may need to upgrade the version of Windows 11 on your laptop as the home version misses many important components. Again, this should be free, alternatively, buy your laptop with Windows 11, 64-bit, Professional.</p> <p>If you are doing a technical module or will work with networking, you will need a USB&lt;-&gt;RS232 serial adapter. These can be purchased inexpensively on-line.</p>"}]}
