# Grading
These modules are graded as 100% continuous assessment (CA), there are no terminal exams.

As you submit CA, I grade it after the closing date. To enable you to be treated in a fair and balanced manner, I use a marking rubric. The idea is that whoever assesses your work will use the same rubric and will grade in a very similar manner. If you find the part of your submission has not been graded, and has no comments against it, bring it to my attention immediately. If you believe I have incorrectly graded your work, discuss with me immediately.

The mark I show in the VLE is your provisional grade, it is how I think your work should be graded. Your provisional grades go to an external examiner and to an exam board word before they become your final grades. However, I don't think there's ever been a case where my provisional grade has not been accepted.

If you have issues with the grade, you need to discuss those issues as soon as I put your provisional grade up in blackboard. Once your final grade is released, that is formal.

For students who do written exams, we have a consultation day. As you have already had the opportunity to see my grading and discuss it, I normally don't see students on consultation day. However, if you do need to see me, make an appointment the week before.
