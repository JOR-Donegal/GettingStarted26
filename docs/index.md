!!! abstract "Getting Started"

At the start of any academic course, there is a deluge of documents leaving students bewildered. This document is a summary of what you need to know to work with me. Due to the way academic courses are structured, you will need to get the same information from any other lecturer you work with.

Please read this document before beginning your work, you are a graduate, and it is expected that you can show attention to detail.

## Videos
In my notes, I sometimes use videos. These are hosted by HEANET. 
Before trying to run a video, if you are logging in from a private computer, go to [media.heanet.ie](https//:media.heanet.ie) and login with your ATU credentials.
